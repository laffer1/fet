= FET 0.5.0 RC 1 =

== Bots: ==
X Find revision which messed up bot code.
X Modify that and following revisions to allow fixes without lag
X Check bot code with respect to player counts. Spectators are currently
	counted as active players, limbo'd ones aren't.
X /addbot command should be disabled when bot_dynamic is on. Plus it needs
	better default parameters
X Make bots balance teams. In rare cases, there are more bots on one team then
	the other.
	(# They will smoothly get out of the way if a human player would
	unbalance teams or would get a "team full" warning)
X Check bot class selection. Lots of cov'opses to be seen lately.
	(# Uses better ratio's now, takes human players into account too.)
? Check dispenser bots. Field ops and medic work buggy: they go in a never
	ending weapon switch or dispense till killed.
- Reduce bot spamming, medics are constantly yelling for ammo.
	(Poor bastards...)
- Bot chat can be heared by everyone from time to time...
X Bot names are not chosen relative to their team in case of auto-bots, all
	American names are used.
X Look at waypointing code, remove unnecessary debug info if present
	( Some stuff like "All nodes parsed in x seconds" can now be toggled on
		with bot_debug set. See bot_debug_value_t in g_local.h)
X Issue a warning once before starting the autowaypoint process.
X Make bots pick things up. Currently, med-/ammopacks fly straight trough them.
	(# Caused by g_noautopickups...)
X /kick allbots kicks nearly all bots, not all if there are more than 4.
? Certain team-only chats from bots get played globally. ( Could be due to a
	server setting where refs see all chat.)
T Bots can use func_invisible_user entities but do not seem to push buttons.
	(# On a closer look, bots do use buttons but need to be in front of
		them.)
X Make special bot cvars cheat protected.
	(# bot_node_edit, bot_node_edit_tankonly, bot_debug )
- When playing against bots only, the end screen just disapears instantly
	because all botes set themselves "ready".

== Tweaks, general ==
S FIX THE DARN MEMORY LEAK
	(# Memory usage is now somewhat stable after binary reloads, though
		bots/players keep allocating memory at a steady pace of 4 KB/s)
? Tank bounding boxes are off compared to the model.
	(# When driving, they act strange so tanks pass where they shouldn't
		and when parked the bounding box stands perpendicular on the
		model's direction.)
S Tanks should turn slower (Seems quite ok though, Jaquboss modified them)
? Tanks should be able to kill players by driving over them
? Make tanks vulnerable to water. ( Make them float though when they have an
	"amphibious" spawnflag set. Hehehe... And yes, those existed.)
X Make weapon tweaking CVars cheatonly
? Make a few CTF and/or Suppremacy maps to showcase the gameplay
X Shift gametypes around so Suppremacy does not change CTF or TDM gametype
	numbers when it's not included in build.
? Make tanks have a "standby" mode and an "off" mode
? Make a FalckonET editor (like the sound editor) to place bot waypoints and
	DM/TDM spawns. (Or maybe not. It would work by hand,)
X New helmets get thrown when a helmet pops. However, the player keeps his
	original helmet on.
	(# This was due to anti-lag code. Fixed by turning
	off larger parts of anti-lag code by means of the g_antilag CVar)
? Spectators which are in "free-float" mode regularly spawn at the
	info_intermission after aprox 10 secs.
	(# Messed up bot code? Seems to be related to the number of bots and,
		in a certain way, with kick allbots.)
? G_GetWeaponSpread: It does get at the bottom in some rare cases (Seems to be
	with scoped weapons combined with no default case...)
- Fireteams can be created during warmup but vapourize when hitting normal play
X Using +attack2 to kick players kills them instantly. I've never seen such a
	mighty foot. (@ #define KICK_DAMAGE )
	(# Fixed, the "weapon" code did not divide g_damage_multi by 100.
		"The foot" now gives 15 HP with default damage settings)
X Players get massive amounts of XP by standing on a medpack they shouldn't be
	able to pick up.
	(# Correction: no problems with medics, but other classes who received the
		medpack "launcher" trough a cheat.)
X Medics do not get XP for healing another medic.
	( Thanks to Dreadnought for this one)
? Make default height jump customisable trough a CVar.
	(# Better: make it toggle-able)
X Some "cvar" scriptactions are broken.
	(# "inc" allways increases with 1, "set" doesn't work)
X Trying to spawn in a non-DM map would crash the server by the means of a
	null-pointer exception.
	(# Now it dies with an explicit error. Not much better, but at least
		you know why it died)

== Tweaks, UI ==
X Fix FalckonET menu -> Player head. Should be None / 3D view / Health (B/W) / 
	Health (Colour) / Stamina (Colour)
X Add +attack2 bind to FalckonET menu
- Add new gametypes to host and ref menus.
S New commands do not auto-complete
	(# We might still need new commands, so this is only partially done)

== Tweaks, Graphics ==
? Fix Thompson's UV wrapping at the back.
? Change Thompson's ironsight to real one
- Retrofit original W:ET skins to FET. (Thompson, Garand, maybe MP40)

== Tweaks, Sounds ==
? Change ammopack drop sound, currently too similar to weapon drop
X Cut jitter from MP40's far sounds. These cause small "clicks" when played.
X Cut jitter from shove sound
- fix looping of the "dead" sound.

== Gameplay tweaks, client ==
X Kicking a func_door_rotating which can be opened by your team/class results
	in a server crash.
X Make thirdperson mode spectator only
X Change g_thirdperson CVar so it reflects speclock, or disables thirdperson
	completely. 
	(# g_thirdperson <= -1 disables thirdperson spectating, anything else
		makes it depends on speclock.)
S Fix Internet radio, Jaquboss disabled it. (Using SDL or not)
	(# Ok, not really started, it's actually completely left out of the
		compile)
? When g_allonmap is on, show players on command map when playing as a
	spectator

== Gameplay tweaks, server things ==
? Fix kill logs, MOD_ messages are messed up. (Killing someone from the tank is
	reported as MOD_MG42, tankshell kills as MOD_SWITCHTEAM and killing
	someone with a STG44 reports as MOD_BAR)
S Add qsay, bp, cp support for ETAdmin
	(# "qsay" and "cp" are there. No bp though, couldn't be bothered to
		write a complete banner print.)
? Banner system 
	(# Will needs "bp" client command, and some server code rotating the
		banners)
? Add a warning command for refs
	(# It's there, but not in the GUI)
? Refs should be able to cancel votes
X Remove complaints for teamkills due to mines
	(# Ok, this a thing fixed in ETMain... See g_disableComplaints bitflags,
		1=mines, 2=airstrike/ffe, 4=mortar. "1" is now the default)
X Spectators spawn at an info_player_intermission with the spawnflags set,
	instead of an info_player_intermission with no spawnflags
	(# Was an issue because Jaquboss used info_player_deathmatch as the new
		spectator spawning point. Reverted and cleaned up to old standard.)
- Remove g_PopHelmets CVar
T The player respawns when he reaches soldier level 4
	(# Disappeared for now, needs more testing.)
