= FET 0.5.0 RC 1 = (Versus FET 0.5.0 alpha)

== Bots: ==
X Find revision which messed up bot code.
X Modify that and following revisions to allow fixes without lag
X Check bot code with respect to player counts. Spectators are currently
	counted as active players, limbo'd ones aren't.
X /addbot command should be disabled when bot_dynamic is on. Plus it needs
	better default parameters
X Make bots balance teams. In rare cases, there are more bots on one team then
	the other.
	(# They will smoothly get out of the way if a human player would
	unbalance teams or would get a "team full" warning)
X Check bot class selection. Lots of cov'opses to be seen lately.
	(# Uses better ratio's now, takes human players into account too.)
X Bot names are not chosen relative to their team in case of auto-bots, all
	American names are used.
X Look at waypointing code, remove unnecessary debug info if present
	( Some stuff like "All nodes parsed in x seconds" can now be toggled on
		with bot_debug set. See bot_debug_value_t in g_local.h)
X Issue a warning once before starting the autowaypoint process.
X Make bots pick things up. Currently, med-/ammopacks fly straight trough them.
	(# Caused by g_noautopickups...)
X /kick allbots kicks nearly all bots, not all if there are more than 4.
X Make special bot cvars cheat protected.
	(# bot_node_edit, bot_node_edit_tankonly, bot_debug )

== Tweaks, general ==
X Make weapon tweaking CVars cheatonly
X Shift gametypes around so Suppremacy does not change CTF or TDM gametype
	numbers when it's not included in build.
X New helmets get thrown when a helmet pops. However, the player keeps his
	original helmet on.
	(# This was due to anti-lag code. Fixed by turning
	off larger parts of anti-lag code by means of the g_antilag CVar)
X Using +attack2 to kick players kills them instantly. I've never seen such a
	mighty foot. (@ #define KICK_DAMAGE )
	(# Fixed, the "weapon" code did not divide g_damage_multi by 100.
		"The foot" now gives 15 HP with default damage settings)
X Players get massive amounts of XP by standing on a medpack they shouldn't be
	able to pick up.
	(# Correction: no problems with medics, but other classes who received the
		medpack "launcher" trough a cheat.)
X Medics do not get XP for healing another medic.
	( Thanks to Dreadnought for this one)
X Some "cvar" scriptactions are broken.
	(# "inc" allways increases with 1, "set" doesn't work)
X Trying to spawn in a non-DM map would crash the server by the means of a
	null-pointer exception.
	(# Now it dies with an explicit error. Not much better, but at least
		you know why it died)

== Tweaks, UI ==
X Fix FalckonET menu -> Player head. Should be None / 3D view / Health (B/W) / 
	Health (Colour) / Stamina (Colour)
X Add +attack2 bind to FalckonET menu

== Tweaks, Graphics ==
X Retrofit original W:ET skins to FET. (Thompson, Garand, maybe MP40)

== Tweaks, Sounds ==
X Cut jitter from MP40's far sounds. These cause small "clicks" when played.
X Cut jitter from shove sound

== Gameplay tweaks, client ==
X Kicking a func_door_rotating which can be opened by your team/class results
	in a server crash.
X Make thirdperson mode spectator only
X Change g_thirdperson CVar so it reflects speclock, or disables thirdperson
	completely. 
	(# g_thirdperson <= -1 disables thirdperson spectating, anything else
		makes it depends on speclock.)

== Gameplay tweaks, server things ==
X Remove complaints for teamkills due to mines
	(# Ok, this a thing fixed in ETMain... See g_disableComplaints bitflags,
		1=mines, 2=airstrike/ffe, 4=mortar. "1" is now the default)
X Spectators spawn at an info_player_intermission with the spawnflags set,
	instead of an info_player_intermission with no spawnflags
	(# Was an issue because Jaquboss used info_player_deathmatch as the new
		spectator spawning point. Reverted and cleaned up to old standard.)
